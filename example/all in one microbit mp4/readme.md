All-in-One Micro:bit Course Code Recording


There are step-by-step code tutorials recorded for 18 lessons in total. However, lessons 9, 10, 13, and 14 were not recorded because the DHT20 and MyServo libraries couldn't be found through the search function.

That said, you can still access the full code for those lessons by directly opening the corresponding .hex files in the lesson folders. These files already include the DHT20 and MyServo libraries, so everything is ready to use.
